			<h3>Vasiliki Kalkounou</h3>
			<p>I am Vasiliki Kalkounou and I am a 1st year undergrad student at NTUA School of Architecture. This is my website for ARCH 4342 Computational Methods in Creative Arts and Sciences. I enjoy this course because it helped me understand how architecture and art are connected to programming and how the three of them can work together, with a very interesting way, for a project. On my website you can find the projects that I have done in my computer science course.</p>

				<h5>Rectangles with variable dimensions</h5>
				<p>In this exercise, my goal was to ensure that the dimensions and shades of the rectangles would change dynamically depending on the position of the mouse. <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/v.kalkounou2006/full/2jqhEai1B" class="project-link"> Click to see my project </a></p>

				<h5>Random circles</h5>
				<p>In this exercise, my goal was to create a program that draws circles with random sizes, colors and slides, in random positions on the screen. <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/v.kalkounou2006/full/D4nKttBkF" class="project-link"> Click to see my project </a></p>

				<h5>Random lines</h5>
				<p>In this exercise, my goal was to create a program that draws lines connecting random points on the top and bottom sides of the canvas, with random colors and transparency. <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/v.kalkounou2006/full/0tKuZnGlL" class="project-link"> Click to see my project </a></p>

				<h5> A work of art inspired by Sol Lewitt</h5>
				<p>While observing Sol Lewitt's artworks I noticed the following pattern. In most of his paintings he uses basic geometric shapes which he incorporates into an irregular canvas. So I decided to try to do something similar, but in my work there are some variables that define the position of the shapes, their size, and the color of their outline. My source of inspiration was the following paintings. <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/v.kalkounou2006/full/VtmgO_NU6" class="project-link"> Click to see my project </a></p>
